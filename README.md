Making Data Meaningful
I love data, numbers, stats, and predictive analytics. Some might say a data junkie. Data is everywhere. We don't always see it. It's in code, applications, products, logs, and even being transmitted as I type this message. Data can be relatable, valuable, and most importantly relevant. What do you want to learn from your data?
